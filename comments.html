          A jungle themed website, consisting of a sticky navigation bar and a banner heading for each page. Due to its potential to be developed into an online portfolio, elements of this such as a contacts footer was included for future convenience.

          <h2>TECHNICAL ASPECTS</h2>
          <div class="ibl">
            <p>The website consists of four basic components on a page. These include the navigation bar, the banner heading, the page content and the ‘contacts’ footer. The navigation bar remains consistent across all four pages where anchor tags surrounded by list items are encapsulated by a flex-box container; to keep consistent positioning and alignment of the content regardless of window resizing. For ease of access, the navigation bar surrounding the container is set with a position of sticky where when the user scrolls down, the bar is fixed to the container’s set off-set.</p>
            <p>Banner headings across the pages consist of centered heading and inner border achieved through an empty ‘div’ tag. The ‘home’ page banner heading also includes an image and heading positioned using flex-box from left to right respectively. A significant visual change occurs when the orientation of the window is considered ‘portrait’, where the heading wraps underneath the image. This was achieved through “@media” where when portrait, flex-direction is set to ‘column’.</p>
            <p>Scattered across the CSS file includes chained selectors such as ‘.banner h1’ used to target the desired tag specifically; where the declaration is not appropriate if applying to just a single selector. This also saves the need to create a need class or id if the selector only requires a small tweak. Within the source code, an id was only assigned to the single image at the ‘home’ page banner heading. This was to target the image specifically as well as to plan for future images on the site.</p>

        <h2>AESTHETICS</h2>
        <div class="ibl">
          <p>The navigation at the top of each page is bordered and its elements are capitalised to invite the user to interact with it. Upon hovering over the element, the text is lifted, bolded and underlined. This indicated to the user that the text is clickable and upon clicking will change the text colour. As mentioned in the section above, the navigation bar was implemented with a sticky position with the intention of making it easier for the user to jump between pages regardless of where they are on the site. Big banner headings appear when the user lands on the site and jumps between pages. This was implemented with the intent of simply catching the user's eye and allowing them to instantly anticipate the page's content. The contact footer is also styled similarly to the banner headings. They stretch the full width of the screen and are opaque; this is in contrast to the main sections of the site where the content covers only a majority of the screen width and is slightly transparent. This design separates the contents apart and focuses on the section being viewed. The main sections are further separated, divided by ‘div’ lines; placing divisions in the main content at the same time keeping together under the same background.

        <h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
        <div class="ibl">
          <p>The website includes a descriptive title in the head tag for user’s with screen readers to know where about on the site they are. A descriptive alternative text is also added within the image tag to grasp its idea and correlation to the content ahead. Scope is applied to table headers to assist screen readers in delivering the table content to the user in a logical format as intended by its developer. Finally, colour contrast was applied where possible for users with vision impairments.</p>
